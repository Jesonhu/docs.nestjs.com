### 介绍

Nest is a framework for building efficient, scalable [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) server-side applications. It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with and fully supports [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) (yet still enables developers to code in pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

Under the hood, Nest makes use of robust HTTP Server frameworks like [Express](https://expressjs.com/) (the default) and [Fastify](https://github.com/fastify/fastify). Nest provides a level of abstraction above these frameworks, but can also expose their APIs directly to the developer. This allows for easy use of the myriad third-party modules which are available for each platform.

#### 哲学

In recent years, thanks to Node.js, JavaScript has become the “lingua franca” of the web for both front and backend applications. This has given rise to awesome projects like [Angular](https://angular.io/), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue), which improve developer productivity and enable the construction of fast, testable, and extensible frontend applications. However, while plenty of superb libraries, helpers, and tools exist for Node (and server-side JavaScript), none of them effectively solve the main problem - **architecture**.

Nest provides an out-of-the-box application architecture which allows developers and teams to create highly testable, scalable, loosely coupled, and easily maintainable applications.

#### 安装

To get started, you can either scaffold the project with the [Nest CLI](/cli/overview), or clone a starter project (both will produce the same outcome).

To scaffold the project with the Nest CLI, run the following commands. This will create a new project directory, and populate the directory with the initial core Nest files and supporting modules, creating a conventional base structure for your project. Creating a new project with the **Nest CLI** is recommended for first-time users. We'll continue with this approach in [First Steps](first-steps).

```bash
$ npm i -g @nestjs/cli
$ nest new project-name
```

Alternatively, to install the TypeScript starter project with **Git**:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nestjs/typescript-starter.git project
$ cd project
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

To install the JavaScript flavor of the starter project, use `javascript-starter.git` in the command sequence above.

You can also manually create a new project from scratch by installing the core and supporting files with **npm** (or **yarn**). In this case, of course, you'll be responsible for creating the project boilerplate files yourself.

```bash
$ npm i --save @nestjs/core @nestjs/common rxjs reflect-metadata
```
